# Core Shared Architecture

This directory contains shared business logic, models, and services that can be used by both web (React) and mobile (React Native) platforms.

## Structure:
- `/models`: Data models and interfaces
- `/services`: Platform-agnostic API services
- `/hooks`: Shared React hooks with platform-agnostic logic
- `/utils`: Utility functions shared across platforms
