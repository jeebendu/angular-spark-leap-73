# Modules Organization

This directory organizes static assets by application module:

- `/patient` - Assets for patient-facing features
- `/doctor` - Assets for doctor-facing features
- `/staff` - Assets for staff-facing features
- `/clinic` - Assets for clinic management features
- `/shared` - Assets shared across multiple modules

This organization helps maintain a clean separation of concerns and makes it easier to find and manage assets related to specific application features.
